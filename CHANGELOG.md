# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented in this file.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 - Unreleased

### Added

- Add shared deterministic test fixtures and informational PR coverage comparisons.
- Promote the size harness into a repository tool
- Add a configurable SDK loader snippet generator that requires an explicit browser bundle URL.
- Map page view ID and referrer to Azure Monitor envelopes
- Add parsed JavaScript stack frames to Azure Monitor browser exception telemetry while
  preserving the original stack trace.
- Add an interactive storefront sample with local span and log exporters and a built-in telemetry
  viewer.

### Changed

- Correlate page views, spans, and logs through shared operation IDs while preserving explicit
  application span contexts.
- Fixed post-merge performance publishing for fork contributions by using the upstream
  workflow context while retaining merged-commit-only checkout and export safeguards.
- Added offline browser performance measurements and explicit result publishing after upstream
  pull requests merge into `main`, including minified, gzip, and Brotli bundle sizes.
- Replaced proposal-era README content with installation, initialization, configuration,
  instrumentation, OTLP, resource detection, bundle size, and published-alpha guidance.
- Cover page view and custom event e2e integration
- Enforce exporter payload limits and test unload delivery.
- Coalesce concurrent `forceFlush()` calls across trace and log processors.
- Report bundle size changes against PR base
- Populate empty Azure Monitor message bodies with `n/a` before ingestion.
- Publish minified, gzip, and Brotli measurements for every bundle-size scenario after merged
  pull requests so scenario regressions can be tracked over time.
- Add absolute size budgets for each published entry point, reported during alpha and
  enforced starting with beta.
