 * @remarks
 * Each key configures one instrumentation, and its value is that instrumentation's own
 * configuration type, so every setting it supports is available and stays in step with its source
 * without being restated here.
 *
 * `fetch` and `xhr` are constructed unless `enabled` is `false`. Every other instrumentation is
 * constructed only when `enabled` is `true`. Nothing is constructed until `getInstrumentations`
 * is called, so a caller that never calls it registers no instrumentations at all.
 *
 * The instrumentations below come from `@opentelemetry/browser-instrumentation`. This distribution
 * selects which of them are constructed and supplies defaults; it does not implement or wrap them.
 * Their source module defaults `enabled` to `true` for all of them.
