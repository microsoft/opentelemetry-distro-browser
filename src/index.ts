// Only the page-view instrumentation's configuration is public. The class itself is not exported
// because `InstrumentationBase` pulls in `@opentelemetry/api`, whose global registration is a
// module side effect that cannot be tree-shaken, so exporting it here would add it to every
// consumer's bundle whether or not they use page views. Its supporting types are internal:
// nothing a consumer can reach today needs them, and exporting them would freeze a provisional
// surface. Widen deliberately if that changes.
