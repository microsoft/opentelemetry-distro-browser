/**
 * Internal semantic conventions for page-view events.
 *
 * @remarks
 * There is no upstream convention for page views.
 *
 * Two rules govern this module:
 *
 * 1. Every event name and attribute key used by the instrumentation lives here, never inline at a
 *    call site, so adopting an upstream convention later is a table edit rather than a rewrite.
 * 2. Everything is an individual `const`. Aggregate semantic-convention objects such as
 *    `SemanticResourceAttributes` are never imported, because they cannot be tree-shaken: reaching
 *    a single attribute through an aggregate costs kilobytes of minified output, against a few
 *    hundred bytes for the individual constants an instrumentation actually uses.
 *
 * This module is internal and is deliberately not part of the package's public API.

 * `SeverityNumber` is a runtime enum, so importing it as a value pulls the whole
 * `@opentelemetry/api-logs` entry point — which executes module-level side effects — into the
 * bundle, and that defeats tree-shaking for consumers who never touch page views. The value is
 * fixed by the OpenTelemetry logs data model, so inlining it is safe. The type-only import above
 * is erased at compile time and keeps the assignment checked.
